# Project: Basic Malware Analysis Lab (Controlled Environment)

## Objective
Analyze simple malware samples in a controlled environment to understand malware behavior safely and document findings.

---

## Lab Environment Setup

- Host OS: Parrot Linux (64-bit)
- Virtualization: VirtualBox installed for isolated VM usage
- Malware sample directory created: `~/malware-lab/samples`

---

## Malware Sample

- Sample used: EICAR test file (standard safe test file for antivirus)
- File downloaded using:
  ```bash
  wget https://secure.eicar.org/eicar.com.txt -O eicar.com
````

* File permissions checked and adjusted as needed

---

## Running the Malware Sample

* Attempted to execute `./eicar.com` resulted in a syntax error since it is a test file, not an executable binary.
* Verified using `file eicar.com` that the file is a text file containing the EICAR test string.

---

## Antivirus Scan using ClamAV

* ClamAV installed and databases updated using:

  ```bash
  sudo freshclam
  ```
* Sample scanned with ClamAV:

  ```bash
  clamscan eicar.com
  ```
* Scan summary:

  * 1 infected file detected (EICAR test file)
  * Demonstrates antivirus correctly identifying test malware signature

---

## Lessons Learned

* Malware samples should be run in isolated environments such as VMs to prevent host contamination.
* Understanding file types and formats is crucial before attempting execution.
* Antivirus tools like ClamAV can detect known malware signatures effectively.
* Basic malware analysis can be started with harmless test files like EICAR.

---

“Next steps planned for this project include expanding the lab environment with additional tools and samples for deeper analysis.”
