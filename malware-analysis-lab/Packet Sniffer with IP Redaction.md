# Packet Sniffer with IP Redaction

## Description

This project implements a basic packet sniffer using Python's `scapy` library. It captures network packets in real-time and saves logs with redacted IP addresses to ensure privacy and security.

## Features

* Live packet capture
* Redaction of sensitive IP addresses
* Saves all data to `captured_packets.txt` and redacted version to `redacted_packets.txt`
* Separate HTTP-only sniffer (`http_sniffer.py`)

## File Overview

* `packet_sniffer.py`: Captures all packets
* `http_sniffer.py`: Captures only HTTP packets
* `sanitize_ips.py`: Handles IP redaction logic
* `captured_packets.txt`: Raw captured data
* `redacted_packets.txt`: Sanitized output
* `http_packets.txt`: Optional HTTP-specific log

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* `scapy`

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install scapy
```

## Usage

Run with elevated privileges:

```bash
sudo python packet_sniffer.py
```

Or run the HTTP-specific version:

```bash
sudo python http_sniffer.py
```

## Notes

* Use responsibly and only on networks you have permission to monitor.
* Output files are generated in the same directory.
